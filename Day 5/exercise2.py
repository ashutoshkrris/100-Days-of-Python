'''
You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

The highest score in the class is: x

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
    student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

# Write your code below this row 👇

max_score = 0

for score in student_scores:
    if score > max_score:
        max_score = score

print(f"The highest score in the class is: {max_score}")
